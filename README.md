# Real-time Object Detection System

## Overview
This Python-based real-time object detection system utilizes YOLOv3 to detect multiple objects in video streams or images, delivering fast and accurate results.

## Features
- üé• Real-time video processing
- üñºÔ∏è Image processing
- üì¶ Multi-object detection
- üè∑Ô∏è Object classification
- üìä Confidence scoring
- ‚ö° Optimized performance

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- YOLOv3 weights file

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd Real-time-object-detection

Install required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download YOLOv3 weights and place the file in the project root directory.

**Usage**
Run the object detection system with:
```
python main.py


**Configuration**
You can configure the system using the following parameters:
- Detection confidence threshold
- Non-maximum suppression threshold
- Input source selection (video/webcam)

**Detection Classes**
The system can detect:
- Persons
- Vehicles (cars, bikes, trucks)
- Animals
- Common indoor/outdoor objects

**Output**
Detection results include:
- Bounding boxes around detected objects
- Class labels
- Confidence scores
- Processed frames/images in the output directory

**Performance**
- Real-time processing capability
- GPU acceleration support (if available)
- Optimized for efficiency
